Let me take you back to when
I was killed and born again
Woke up in the light convinced
My life had made it to its end
Burning up beneath the sun,
While my father drained of blood
If He's there I've got a message
For the man that's up above
Fuck
You

If He's home I've got a message from below
Getting out is not enough
If nobody else can come
If He's home I've got a message
For the man above

Here am I - Take me to the pearly gates
So I can look you in the eye
When I spit in your face
Here am I - Take me to the pearly gates
Don't let 'em hit you on the way out
When I take your place
