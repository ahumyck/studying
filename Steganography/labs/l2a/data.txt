This is a place i know too well
Been down here a while if you can't tell
And I have analysed and tried my best to justify
The sorrow I have brought upon myself...


Am I addicted to the misery? Is this how I'll always be?
Grinding the salt into every wound
Am I in love with all my ailments, glutton for punishment?
You can't trust me to be there for you :(
